## Problem Statement
<hr>
Find all patterns in an array of intgers

* The length of pattern is >= 2 integers.
* Patterns must occur in sequential integers within the array.
* Output will contain the pattern and the number of times it occurs in the list.
* The pattern will have to occur at least twice to be considered.

### Test Cases
_input_ - [1,2,3,5,6,0,1,2,3,5,2,5]
<br>
_output_ - <br>
[1,2], 2 <br>
[1,2,3], 2 <br>
[2,3], 2 <br>
[3,5], 2 <br>

#### Explanation
* Each of the pattern mentioned above is occurring multiple times in the array
